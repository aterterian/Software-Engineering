# Summary 
## The Coming Software Apocalypse

### Problem:

  - Attempting to build systems that are beyond our ability to intellectually manage
  - Trouble with making things out of code: The complexity is invisible to the eye
  - Software failures are failures of understanding and of imagination
  - The problems happening with software has to do with requirements, not coding errors
  - Code turns to spaghetti when it accretes over many years (feature after feature piling on top of it)

### Idea:

* No need to code if you want to do interesting stuff with computers (like Photoshop and Squarespace)
* Tools to see a behaviour and change it immediately -> like playing with it in your hands (responsive environment)
* Generate code automatically (and verify correctness)
* Model-based approach
  * Focus less on the machine and more on the problem/requirements (have a "blueprint" of the problem instead of code)
  * Focus on high*level structure of a system, rather than the code that implements it
* Programmers jump right into writing code (architects draw detailed plans before starting to build something)
* Programmers should use TLA+ (or math in general) to handle complexity
